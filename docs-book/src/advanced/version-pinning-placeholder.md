# Version Pinning (Placeholder)

Version pinning is planned, but not active yet.

Current direction:

- backend-capability based (not every package manager supports strict pinning)
- opt-in per package/backend
- policy-driven handling for unsupported pin requests (`warn` or `error`)
- backward-compatible config/state evolution only

This page is a placeholder so future implementation can land without large docs refactor.
